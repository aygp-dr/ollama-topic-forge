Comprehensive repository review and 0.5.0 release preparation:

Implementation notes:

Thought process:
- Conducted systematic review of codebase for 0.5.0 release readiness
- Identified critical Makefile issues preventing proper build
- Prioritized high-impact fixes for immediate functionality
- Used todo list to track progress systematically

Debugging/Issues encountered:
- Duplicate 'dist' target caused by DIST_DIR variable conflict
- Makefile pipe syntax created build cycles
- BUILD_DIR named 'build' conflicted with 'build' target name
- VERSION variable expansion not working in version command
- Repository URLs in README pointed to placeholder values

Cleanup performed:
- Fixed all Makefile syntax and dependency issues
- Updated version from 0.1.0 to 0.5.0 to match release notes
- Corrected repository URLs in documentation
- Added proper build artifact exclusion in .gitignore
- Verified core tool functionality with dry-run test

Technical decisions:
- Changed BUILD_DIR to '.build' to avoid target name conflicts
- Used backticks in version command for reliable shell expansion
- Prioritized functional fixes over cosmetic shellcheck warnings
- Maintained experimental engineering methodology throughout

Testing performed:
- make build: Successfully builds without errors
- make test: All unit tests pass
- make run: Tool executes properly in dry-run mode
- make version: Correctly displays v0.5.0
- Integration test: Generated valid GitHub topics

Repository status:
- All high-priority issues resolved
- Core functionality verified working
- Ready for 0.5.0 release
- Build system fully functional
- Documentation updated and accurate

Future improvements:
- Address remaining shellcheck warnings in experiment scripts
- Consider adding more comprehensive integration tests
- Evaluate performance optimizations for large repositories
