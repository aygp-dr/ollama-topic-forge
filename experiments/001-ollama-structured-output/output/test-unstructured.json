Scheme's concise syntax and macro system enable developers to write elegant and expressive code that is easy to understand and maintain.\n2. Scheme's dynamic typing and flexible data structures allow for rapid prototyping and experimentation, making it ideal for systems development where requirements may change frequently.\n3. Scheme's implementation is often embedded in the hardware itself, providing direct access to memory and hardware resources, which can be crucial for low-level system programming applications such as operating systems and device drivers.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[128006,9125,128007,271,38766,1303,33025,2696,25,6790,220,2366,18,271,128009,128006,882,128007,271,861,220,18,7720,315,1701,44881,369,1887,15840,304,832,11914,1855,13,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,8586,527,2380,7720,315,1701,44881,369,1887,15840,1473,16,13,44881,596,64694,20047,323,18563,1887,7431,13707,311,3350,26861,323,78223,2082,430,374,4228,311,3619,323,10519,627,17,13,44881,596,8915,20061,323,19303,828,14726,2187,369,11295,1760,67247,323,66196,11,3339,433,10728,369,6067,4500,1405,8670,1253,2349,14134,627,18,13,44881,596,8292,374,3629,23711,304,279,12035,5196,11,8405,2167,2680,311,5044,323,12035,5070,11,902,649,387,16996,369,3428,11852,1887,15840,8522,1778,439,10565,6067,323,3756,12050,13],"total_duration":4283794250,"load_duration":829383458,"prompt_eval_count":40,"prompt_eval_duration":1405196917,"eval_count":107,"eval_duration":2048459958}
