Context: Scheme/Guile Development Environment Setup
===================================================

Purpose:
- Enable professional Scheme development workflow for ollama-topic-forge project
- Integrate Emacs with Geiser, Paredit, TRAMP, and Org mode for Guile development
- Provide consistent project environment across development sessions

Implementation Details:
1. Added PROJECT_ROOT and PROJECT_NAME exports to Makefile for environment consistency
2. Created .envrc with project-specific environment variables including:
   - GUILE_LOAD_PATH configuration
   - Ollama settings
   - Emacs session naming
3. Implemented emacs-dev and emacs-config Makefile targets that:
   - Generate project-specific Emacs configuration
   - Start named tmux session with configured Emacs
   - Report TTY for remote access capabilities

Considerations:
- Used tmux for persistent development sessions
- Configured Geiser with guile3 as default implementation
- Enabled Paredit for structured S-expression editing
- Set up Org mode with Scheme babel support for literate programming
- TRAMP configured for potential remote development needs

Issues Addressed:
- Lack of integrated development environment for Scheme code
- Need for consistent project configuration across sessions
- Missing tooling for effective Guile development

Timing:
- Implementation completed: 2025-08-06
- Build system version: 0.5.0

Technical Choices:
- use-package for declarative Emacs package management
- tmux for session persistence and remote accessibility
- Project-specific .el file to avoid polluting global Emacs config
- Makefile integration for reproducible environment setup
